# Neural Network Algorithm
Neural Network algorithm using MATLAB/Octave language. Using fminunc to solve for local minimum. 
Follows content that was taught in Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course.

INTRODUCTION
------------
This repo serves as a place to store these neural network algorithms, coded as part of my own learning while taking Andrew Ng's
Learning course.

ADDTIONAL NOTES
---------------
- Only minor further improvements for these codes expected
- Serves as the baseline for building neural network algorithm in Python3
